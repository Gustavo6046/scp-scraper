# _'SCPScraper, Inc.'_

**Description:** This is a small example that illustrates the
simplicity of obtaining and scraping data from the Web using
Node.js. It is, unsurprisingly, even easier when using libraries.
This example only uses `request` for downloading the HTML data from
the website, and `cheerio` jQuery to parse this data.

**Example Procedure:**

```js
> const scraper = require('scp-scrape');
```
